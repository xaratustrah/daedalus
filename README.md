## Installation
Please download the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Newest versions require setting up username / password already in the imager tool. You can also enable SSH from there. Then you can expand file system using the script `raspi-config`. Then you need a couple of things:

```
sudo apt udpate
sudo apt -y install git python3-pip
```

The clone the repository and go inside that directory and type (you may need to provide the command line arg `--break-system-packages` before the `-r` and before `.` below, depending on your system, and how you are using your Raspberry Pi. Please use with care!):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
```

For uninstalling you can type:

```
pip3 uninstall daedalus
```
